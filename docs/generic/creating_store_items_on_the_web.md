# Creating Store Items

To create store items on the web, navigate to your [GameFuse.co](http://gamefuse.co/)
home page, and sign in if you are not already.

You can click on your *Game* on the homepage you want to add items for. On this
page if you scroll down to the Store Items section, you will see the
`+ STORE ITEM` button, here you can add in:

- `Name`
- `Cost`
- `Description`
- `Category`

All are mandatory but do not need to used in your game.

The store feature does not integrate real payment systems. This is for items
you want your users to be able to unlock with in-game currency (credits) or with
achievements in the game. How you configure that is up to you.
