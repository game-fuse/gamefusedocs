# Signing game users up

Enable users to sign up in your UnrealEngine game with the following node.
These users will be saved in your GameFuse game and can then login from other
devices, since the data is saved online.

In any of your game's blueprints, simply right-click search for
`GetGameFuseUser`.

Utilize this subsystem node to acquire a `GameFuseUser` object. Once you have
this object you drag it and search for the `SignUp` node.
