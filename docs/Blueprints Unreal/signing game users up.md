# Signing game users up

Enable users to sign up in your UnrealEngine game with the following node. They will be saved on your GameFuse Game and can then login from other devices since the data is saved online.

In any of your game's blueprints, simply right-click and initiate a search for "GetGameFuseUser." Utilize this subsystem node to acquire a GameFuseUser Object. Once you have this object, you can proceed by dragging it and searching for the "SignUp" node.
