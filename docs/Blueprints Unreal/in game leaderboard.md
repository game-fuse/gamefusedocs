# In game leaderboard

The `Add Leaderboard Entry` node is used to add a score to a leaderboard with a
specified name.

Alternatively, you can utilize the `Add Leaderboard Entry With Attributes` node
to add a score and extra attributes (metadata) to a leaderboard with a
specific name.

## Retrieve

Leaderboards can be fetched in two ways:

1. for a specific leaderboard name which gathers all the high scores for
   all users in the game
2. for a specific user: you can download the current user's leaderboard data
   for all instances of the leaderboard name
