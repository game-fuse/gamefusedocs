# Using Credits

Credits are a numeric attribute of each game user. It is a simple integer value. You can add them manually and they are detracted automatically upon store item purchases. Below is a script to demonstrate the full lifecycle of credits on a signed-in user. First, it prints the credits your signed-in user has, then prints the cost of the first store item, then it adds credits to your user. Because this syncs with the server, it requires a callback. Upon success, you will see the user now has more credits when logged. At this point in time, you can then run the purchase store item function successfully.
