## Connecting To GameFuse

The first step in using GameFuse after it is installed and your account is 
regestered is to use the `SetUpGame` node.

After the step you can run other nodes to register, sign in users, read and
write game data.

Starting from any blueprints in your game use the `SetUpGame` node as part of
your game initialization process. This process should be one of the first
things that happen when your game starts.
