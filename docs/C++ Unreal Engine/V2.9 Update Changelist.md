# C++ Plugin V2.9 Update

This update brings significant improvements to the GameFuse C++ plugin's architecture and functionality. The changes focus on improving reliability, performance, and developer experience. This version has some breaking changes, so please see the [C++ migration guide](V2.9%20Unreal%20C++%20Migration%20Guide.md) and [Blueprint migration guide](../Blueprints%20Unreal/V2.9%20Blueprint%20Migration%20Guide.md) for instructions on updating your code.

## Deprecation Notice
The `GameFuseCore` class is now deprecated and will be removed in V3.0. All functionality has been moved to the new `GameFuseManager` [subsystem](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/programming-subsystems-in-unreal-engine). Please refer to the migration guide for assistance in updating your code. `GameFuseManager` is the conversion of `GameFuseCore` into a subsystem, similar to was previously accessed. Upcoming features will also make use of subsystems.
### Breaking Changes
- Changes all latent nodes to use Delegates, GameFuseManager and GameFuseUser now have delegates instead.
  - delegates can be bound in BP and C++
- All functions that use the `GameFuseCore` class are now `GameFuseManager` functions.
- All functions return Structs instead of UObjects.

Please see the migration guide for instructions on updating your code.
