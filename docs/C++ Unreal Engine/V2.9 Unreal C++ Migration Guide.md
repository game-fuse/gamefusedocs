# C++ Plugin V2.9 Migration Guide

This guide will help you update your code to work with the V2.9 version of the GameFuse C++ plugin. The main changes involve moving from `GameFuseCore` to the new `GameFuseManager` subsystem and updating data types from UObjects to structs.

## Major Changes Overview

1. `GameFuseCore` → `GameFuseManager` Subsystem
2. UObject-based data → Struct-based data
3. Latent nodes → Delegate-based callbacks

## Step-by-Step Migration

### 1. Replace GameFuseCore with GameFuseManager

#### Before:
```cpp
UGameFuseCore* GameFuseCore = NewObject<UGameFuseCore>();
GameFuseCore->SetUpGame("YourGameId", "YourToken");
```

#### After:
```cpp
UGameFuseManager* GameFuseManager = GetGameInstance()->GetSubsystem<UGameFuseManager>();
GameFuseManager->SetUpGame("YourGameId", "YourToken", CompletionCallback);
```


!!! note "The GameFuseManager pointer can be stored as a member variable as it is linked to the game instance."
```cpp
TObjectPtr<UGameFuseManager> GameFuseManager;
```
### 2. Update Data Type Usage
Structs have been introduced for GameData, UserData, StoreItems, LeaderboardEntries and Leaderboards. See [GameFuseStructLibrary](https://github.com/game-fuse/game-fuse-cpp/blob/main/Source/GameFuse/Public/Library/GameFuseStructLibrary.h) for schema of these structs.

#### Before:
```cpp
TArray<UGameFuseStoreItem*> StoreItems = UGameFuseCore::GetGameStoreItems();
for (UGameFuseStoreItem* Item : StoreItems)
{
    FString ItemName = Item->GetName();
    int32 Cost = Item->GetCost();
}
```

#### After:
```cpp
TArray<FGFStoreItem> StoreItems = UGameFuseManager::GetGameStoreItems();
for (const FGFStoreItem& Item : StoreItems)
{
    FString ItemName = Item.Name;
    int32 Cost = Item.Cost;
}
```

### 3. Update Delegate Callbacks

Delegates are now declared as [Dynamic Multicast Delegates](https://benui.ca/unreal/delegates-advanced/), which return the `FGFAPIResponse` struct. You can bind to these delegates in your C++ code by creating a `FGameFuseAPIResponseCallback` delegate and binding to it, then passing it to the API call.

#### Before:
```cpp
UFUNCTION()
void OnGameSetup();

// In your code
GameFuseCore->SetUpGame("GameId", "Token");
```

#### After:
```cpp
UFUNCTION()
void OnGameSetup(bool bSuccess, const FString& Response);

// In your code
FGameFuseAPIResponseCallback Callback;
Callback.BindDynamic(this, &YourClass::OnGameSetup);
GameFuseManager->SetUpGame("GameId", "Token", Callback);
```

### 5. Update Leaderboard Access

Leaderboards now hold a map of leaderboard names to leaderboard entries to allow for multiple leaderboards. GetLeaderboardEntries returns an Array of FGFLeaderboardEntry structs.
Fetching is still 1 leaderboard at a time based on LeaderboardName.
#### Before:
```cpp
TArray<UGameFuseLeaderboardItem*> Leaderboard = User->GetLeaderboards();
```

#### After:
```cpp
const TMap<FString, FGFLeaderboard>& Leaderboards = Manager->GetLeaderboards();
const TArray<FGFLeaderboardEntry>& Entries = Manager->GetLeaderboardEntries("LeaderboardName");
```

## Blueprint Changes

If you're using GameFuse in any blueprints, see [the blueprint migration guide](/docs/Blueprints%20Unreal/V2.9%20Blueprint%20Migration%20Guide.md) for instructions on updating your blueprints.

If you're familiar with Unreal C++, migrating Blueprints will be a breeze, check the TLDR in the migration guide for high level instructions. You can do it!


## Common Issues and Solutions

### Compile Errors with Old UObject Types
If you see compile errors related to `UGameFuseStoreItem`, `UGameFuseLeaderboardItem`, or other UObject types, replace them with their struct equivalents:

- `UGameFuseStoreItem` → `FGFStoreItem`
- `UGameFuseLeaderboardItem` → `FGFLeaderboardEntry`
- `UGameFuseUser` → `FGFUserData`

### Missing Callback Responses
If your callbacks aren't being called, ensure you're:
1. Using the new delegate system
2. Binding the delegates before making the API call
3. Using the correct callback signature (FGFAPIResponse)
